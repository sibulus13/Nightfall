          Nightfalls was created by a developer who, after missing one too many
          spectacular sunsets while working, decided to solve the problem once
          and for all. What started as a personal tool to catch nature&apos;s
          daily show has grown into a platform for anyone who believes that
          every perfect sunset is worth witnessing.
